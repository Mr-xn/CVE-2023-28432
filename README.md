## Dec

> Minio is a Multi-Cloud Object Storage framework. Prior to RELEASE.2023-03-20T20-16-18Z,
    an attacker can use crafted requests to bypass metadata bucket name checking and
    put an object into any bucket while processing `PostPolicyBucket`. To carry out
    this attack, the attacker requires credentials with `arn:aws:s3:::*` permission,
    as well as enabled Console API access. This issue has been patched in RELEASE.2023-03-20T20-16-18Z.
    As a workaround, enable browser API access and turn off `MINIO_BROWSER=off`.
